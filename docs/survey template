A Survey in Quantitative Methods of Experimental Economics
Welcome to the survey by the Fullhouse Group!
With our survey, we want to record what importance donation decisions have for you. The survey takes about XX minutes in total.

General Instructions
 
Today you will be participating in an economic experiment, earnings from the experiment will be paid out in “Euros” at the end of the experiment. The game does not partner you with any other participants. 
At the end of the game, one participant will be randomly chosen and paid according to the decision they made in the according treatment. Therefore, the game and the decisions are not hypothetical. Depending on the size of your chosen donation, you will keep the rest of the payoff.
