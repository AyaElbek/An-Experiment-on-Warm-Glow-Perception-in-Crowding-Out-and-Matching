# UX Research Case Study: Warm Glow Perception in Crowding Out and Matching

## Introduction

This repository contains the case study of an experiment conducted on Warm Glow Perception in Crowding Out and Matching. The study was part of the "Quantitative Methods of Experimental Economics" seminar at the University of Kassel, Faculty of Environmental and Behavioral Economics.

## Project Description

### Objective
The primary objective of this study was to analyze whether a connection between warm glow and crowding out, as well as matching, can be established. 

### Participants
46 participants took part in the experiment, comprising students from the Quantitative Methods in Experimental Economics course and additional participants from an online survey.

## Methodology

### Literature Review
A thorough literature review was conducted to understand the existing theories and findings related to warm glow and crowding out.

### Experimental Design
The experiment used a within-subject design with three conditions:
1. **Control**: Participants decide how much of their endowment to donate.
2. **Treatment 1 (Crowding Out)**: The donated amount is topped up to reach 10 Euros.
3. **Treatment 2 (Matching)**: The experimenters match the donated amount.

### Hypotheses
1. **H1**: Topping up subjects' donations will lead to significantly lower donation amounts (lower warm glow).
2. **H2**: Matching subjects' donations will lead to significantly higher donation amounts (higher warm glow).

### Data Collection
- Participants completed a Positive Affectivity Negative Affectivity Schedule (PANAS) survey before and after each treatment.
- Donation amounts were recorded for each treatment.

### Data Analysis
Descriptive statistics and regression analysis were used to analyze the data.

## Results

### Descriptive Data
- The average donation amounts for Control, Treatment 1, and Treatment 2 were 5.89, 4.76, and 5.78 Euros, respectively.
- PANAS scores indicated changes in emotional states before and after donations.

### Regression Analysis
- A strong negative relationship was found between crowding out and donation amounts, supporting H1.
- No significant effect was found for the matching treatment, failing to support H2.

## Conclusion

The study provides partial confirmation of the hypotheses. Topping up donations led to lower donation amounts, indicating a crowding out effect. However, matching donations did not significantly increase donation amounts.
